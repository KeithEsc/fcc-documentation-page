            <p>Expedited service is used when people need to know that their shipment will arrive at its destination within a defined, usually short timeframe – but also safely and securely. There is no better way to achieve this than with Boyle Transportation, where our numerous differentiating characteristics of the business are fundamental to achieving the end goal.</p>
            <p>Our overall methodology has resulted in 100% on-time performance for expedited shipments. Since our vehicles are staffed by teams of two transportation professionals, we provide next-day delivery up to 1,000 miles.</p>
            <p>We provide door-to-door expedited service throughout the continental USA and Eastern Canada, with assurances that your shipments will arrive safely and on time. Our professional team provides coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
            <ul><li><p>Shipment Tracking</p>
                <ul><li>From the moment your shipment is initiated, our Operations Center monitors every detail and provides you with web-based, real-time tracking updates throughout its entire journey, so you know exactly what’s going on and that the shipment is on schedule. Our proprietary route monitoring system provides you with full visibility of your shipment at all times via web-based or mobile app. If you would prefer to speak with someone directly, our Operations Center personnel are also accessible around the clock.</li></ul>
